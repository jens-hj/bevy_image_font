/// A Bevy plugin for rendering image-based fonts.
///
/// This plugin enables support for fonts stored as single images (e.g., PNG),
/// where each glyph is represented by a section of the image. It handles:
///
/// - Loading `ImageFont` assets, which describe the glyph layout.
/// - Registering the `ImageFont` and `ImageFontText` types for use in your app.
/// - Marking updated fonts as dirty, ensuring proper re-rendering.
///
/// ### Features
/// The plugin conditionally includes additional functionality based on enabled
/// features:
/// - `rendered`: Enables support for rendering image fonts.
/// - `atlas_sprites`: Enables support for more advanced atlas-based sprite
///   functionality.
///
/// ### Usage
/// To use this plugin, add it to your Bevy app:
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
/// use bevy_image_font::ImageFontPlugin;
///
/// App::new()
///     .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
///     .add_plugins(ImageFontPlugin)
///     .run();
/// ```
///
/// Ensure that `ImageFont` assets are properly loaded and configured using the
/// asset system, and consider the relevant examples in the documentation for
/// advanced use cases.
