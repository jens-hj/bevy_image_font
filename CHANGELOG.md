## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.1] - 2025-01-24

### Added

- **Validation and Accessors**:

  - Introduced `ImageFontDescriptor::new` for creating validated instances.
  - Added accessor methods (`image`, `layout`) for retrieving the values of deprecated public fields.
  - Added `ValidationError` to `ImageFontLoadError` for encapsulating validation issues.

- **Core System Tests**:

  - Added tests for the `sync_texts_with_font_changes` system to validate:
    - Correct handling of `AssetEvent` variants.
    - Accurate change detection for `ImageFontText` components when their respective `ImageFont` is changed.

- **Component and Layout Tests**:

  - Introduced test modules for `ImageFontDescriptor` and `ImageFontLayout`:
    - Verified `ImageFontDescriptor::new` creation and validation logic.
    - Tested `ImageFontLayout`'s character map generation for all layout types (`Automatic`, `Manual`, `ManualMonospace`).
    - Added tests for edge cases like repeated characters and invalid image dimensions.

- **Loader Tests**:

  - Comprehensive coverage for `ImageFontLoader` functionality:
    - Validated `read_and_validate_font_descriptor` for proper descriptor parsing and validation.
    - Ensured `descriptor_to_character_map_and_layout` handles both valid and invalid inputs.

- **Integration Tests**:

  - Verified the behavior of `ImageFontPlugin` integration with the Bevy framework:
    - Tested asset loading setup.
    - Confirmed correct registration of `ImageFont` and `ImageFontText` types with the reflection system.
  - Ensured correctness of `ImageFont::filter_string` and its integration with layout character maps.

### Changed

- **Field Deprecation**:

  - Marked `ImageFontDescriptor` fields (`image` and `layout`) as deprecated, with a plan to make them private in version 8.0.
  - Updated documentation to guide users toward using `new`, `image`, and `layout` methods.

- **Gizmo Debugging**:

  - Added green cross markers to `render_sprite_gizmos` for enhanced visual debugging of sprite positions.

### Fixed

- Resolved an issue where incorrect width and anchor calculations caused text misalignment ([#10]).
- `ImageFontGizmoData` was not being updated in `update_existing_sprites`.

[#10]: https://github.com/ilyvion/bevy_image_font/issues/10

### Deprecated

- **Error Variants**:
  - Deprecated `ImageFontLoadError::EmptyImagePath` and `ImageFontLoadError::EmptyLayoutString` in favor of the `ValidationError` variant.

### Notes

- These changes improve the `ImageFontDescriptor` API by moving toward an encapsulated design while maintaining backward compatibility until version 8.0.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-01-01

### Added

#### Features

- Introduced the `rendered` feature for text rendering to `Sprite` and `ImageNode` components, using `ImageFontPreRenderedText` and `ImageFontPreRenderedUiText`.
- Added the **`atlas_sprites`** feature to enable text rendering with individual sprites for each character via a texture atlas. Includes:
  - `ImageFontSpriteText` component for sprite-based text rendering with configurable color and anchor.
  - Optional gizmo rendering via the `gizmos` feature.
- Introduced `ImageFontLoaderSettings` to allow custom `ImageSampler` specification for font asset loading.
- Added `ImageFontTextData` for tracking sprite-entity relationships and optimizing updates.
- Introduced a `validate` method to `ImageFontSettings` to ensure valid `image` paths and layout strings.

#### Documentation

- Enabled comprehensive documentation for all features on `docs.rs`, utilizing `doc_cfg` and `doc_auto_cfg` features.
- Expanded inline documentation for:
  - `ImageFont` and its fields (`atlas_layout`, `texture`, `atlas_character_map`).
  - `ImageFontLayout` variants and layout methods.
  - `ImageFontSettings`, detailing paths and layout mappings.
  - Error enums (`ImageFontLoadError` and `ImageFontRenderError`) with explanations of failure scenarios.
- Enhanced documentation for `ImageFontPlugin`, including usage examples and feature descriptions.

#### Tooling

- Added stricter linting rules in `Cargo.toml` to improve code quality.
- Added Rust lint configuration to `Cargo.toml`.
- Added the `camino` crate (version 1.1.9) with `serde1` feature for robust UTF-8 path handling.

### Changed

#### Core Library

- Removed `pub use` statements for `rendered` and `atlas_sprites` modules in `src/lib.rs`:
  - Users must now import items from these modules.

#### Examples

- Adjusted imports in `atlased_sprite.rs`, `rendered_sprite.rs`, and `rendered_ui.rs` to reflect the removal of `pub use` statements

#### Refactoring

- Refactored text rendering systems into the `rendered` module, conditional on the `rendered` feature.
- Renamed examples for clarity:
  - `sprite.rs` to `rendered_sprite.rs`.
  - `bevy_ui.rs` to `rendered_ui.rs`.

#### Features and APIs

- Made internal rendering text function private.
- Updated `Cargo.toml` to make the `image` dependency optional, activated only with the `rendered` feature.
- Replaced `PathBuf` with `Utf8PathBuf` in `ImageFontSettings` for stricter validation and compatibility with non-ASCII paths.
- Updated error messages in `ImageFontLoader` for better diagnostics.

### Fixed

- Resolved inconsistencies in type annotations, parameter naming, and error handling across core modules.
- Corrected link to `rendered_sprite.rs` in the "Note on Pixel Accuracy" section.

### Removed

- Removed redundant font setup logic from individual examples, consolidating it into a reusable `common` module.

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed `ImageFontSpriteText` to `ImageFontPreRenderedText` and `ImageFontUiText` to `ImageFontPreRenderedUiText`.
- Users of the library will need to update their import paths for components and related types from the `rendered` and `atlas_sprites` modules rather than from the root.

## [0.6.0] - 2024-12-31

### Added

- `ImageFontSpriteText` and `ImageFontUiText` were added as replacements for `ImageFontBundle` and `ImageFontUiBundle`. These now use Bevy 0.15's new required components to ensure that the entity has the components required to show the image font text.

### Changed

- Crate updated to target Bevy 0.14.

### Removed

- `ImageFontBundle` and `ImageFontUiBundle` have been removed.

## [0.5.1] - 2024-12-30

### Fixed

- Accidentally left behind some old repo links to the previous maintainer's repo.

## [0.5.0] - 2024-12-30

### Changed

- Crate renamed from `extol_image_font` to `bevy_image_font` and has a new maintainer.
- Crate updated to target Bevy 0.14.

### Fixed

- Only declare `ImageFontUiBundle` when feature `ui` is enabled, as it's useless otherwise and because `ImageBundle` is unavailable without `bevy`'s `bevy_ui` feature enabled.
- Clarify why text might sometimes render blurry in README. Update `sprite` example to illustrate work-arounds.

## [0.4.0] - 2024-04-04

- First public release; prior versions are not on Cargo.
