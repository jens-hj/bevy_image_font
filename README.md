`bevy_image_font` enables rendering fonts stored as single images (e.g., PNG), with each letter at a predefined position. This crate focuses specifically on image-based fonts, often called "pixel fonts," used in game development. The term "image font" was chosen for precision, as bitmap fonts in formats like OTB might also be referred to as "pixel fonts."

## Features

### Supported

- Unicode (single codepoints)
- Defining character coordinates via strings (see example asset)
- Manual specification of rectangles (including non-uniform sizes)

### Planned Enhancements

- Padding and offsets for texture layouts
- Inline newlines in strings

### Out of Scope

- Rendering from traditional bitmap fonts
- Automatic line wrapping

### Known Limitations

- Space characters require a blank texture region.
- Newlines are currently unsupported.

## Getting Started

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bevy = "0.15"
bevy_image_font = "0.8"
```

### Usage

Add an `ImageFontText` component to an entity along with:

- A `Sprite` and a `ImageFontPreRenderedText` components to render the text onto the associated `Sprite`, or
- A `ImageNode` and `ImageFontPreRenderedUiText` components to render the text onto the associated `ImageNode`, or
- A `ImageFontSpriteText` component for atlas-based text rendering.

#### Minimal Example

Here's a minimal example of using `bevy_image_font` to render text.[^cfg] :

```rust,no_run
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy_image_font::{ImageFontPlugin, ImageFontText};
#[cfg(feature = "atlas_sprites")]
use bevy_image_font::atlas_sprites::ImageFontSpriteText;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, ImageFontPlugin))
        .add_systems(Startup, setup)
        .run();
}

fn setup(mut commands: Commands, asset_server: Res<AssetServer>) {
    let font_handle = asset_server.load("path/to/font_layout.image_font.ron");

    commands.spawn((
        #[cfg(feature = "atlas_sprites")]
        ImageFontSpriteText::default(),
        ImageFontText::default()
            .text("Hello, world!")
            .font(font_handle.clone()),
    ));
}
```

This example sets up a simple Bevy application with an `ImageFontText` component, rendering "Hello, world!" using a specified font image and layout.

See examples for more details:

- [Rendered sprite example](https://github.com/ilyvion/bevy_image_font/blob/main/examples/rendered_sprite.rs): Using pixel fonts for in-world text like damage numbers.
- [Rendered UI example](https://github.com/ilyvion/bevy_image_font/blob/main/examples/rendered_ui.rs): Using `bevy_asset_loader` for texture and font handling.
- [Atlased Sprite Example](https://github.com/ilyvion/bevy_image_font/blob/main/examples/atlased_sprite.rs): Demonstrates rendering text with a texture atlas, including animations for dynamic text display and changing colors.

#### Note on Pixel Accuracy

Bevy anchors sprites at the center by default, which may cause odd-dimensioned sprites to appear blurry. To avoid this, use non-`Center` anchors like `Anchor::TopLeft` or adjust sprite translations. Refer to the [rendered sprite example](https://github.com/ilyvion/bevy_image_font/blob/main/examples/rendered_sprite.rs) for details.

### Optional Features

- You can disable the default `atlas_sprites` feature if you don't use `ImageFontSpriteText`.
- You can disable the default `rendered` feature if you don't use `ImageFontPreRenderedText` or `ImageFontPreRenderedUiText`. This removes the dependency on the `image` crate.
- You can disable the default `ui` feature if you don't use `ImageFontPreRenderedUiText` to remove a dependency on the `bevy/bevy_ui` feature.
- If your project depends on this crate and you need support for non-PNG formats, add your own dependency on the same version of `image` and enable the relevant features.
